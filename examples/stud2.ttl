# b. Choose an appropriate prefix/namespace for your RDF graph. Write down its declaration, as well as the declarations of the prefixes you may need later on ? :
# namespace: <http://www.example.com/Spider-Man/>,  <http://www.example.com/Spider-Man-relations/>,
# @prefix spm, spmr
@prefix spm: <http://www.example.com/Spider-Man/> .
@prefix spmr:  <http://www.example.com/Spider-Man-relations/> . 
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .

# c. Create a vocabulary (classes and properties) that you will use for modelling. Write down their definitions (stating e.g., that Student is a class, while isTaughtBy is a property) as Turtle triples.
# 1 .
# properties: 
# itsGirlfriend   
# isRealName       
# hasWorkFor       
# hasFirstAppeared 
# hasFriend

# hasActor         
# hasappearedIn   
# hasVehicule      
# hasFeature
# Classes: superHero, Spider-Man,characters
# d. ) Describe some domain knowledge in 3 RDFS axioms of different types (out of subClassOf ,subPropertyOf, domain and range).
# 1. subClassOf
# spm:spiderMan rdf:subClassOf spm:superHero.
# # 2. domain
# spmr:knowFor rdf:domain spm:superHero.
# # 3. range
# spmr:isEnemyOf rdf:range xsd:string.

# e. ) Write at least 20 triples stating facts about your chosen domain using the vocabulary you have defined. Include at least one blank node that appears in more than 1 triple (for instance, you could use it to represent complex attributes). Make sure in your RDF graph you have links between individual resources (e.g., triples like sw is taught by eb) and between resources and literal values (e.g., triples like swâ€™s name is "Semantic Technologies...").
